Lightlogger is an open source framework to read, log and analyze data from a light source (e.g. LED).
The framework was developed and tested by interfacing a VT90N2 LDR photoresistor, an Arudino UNO and a Raspberry PI.
The framework is provided with scripts to:
- interface the photoresistor with the Arduino board
- interface the Arduino with the Raspberry PI
- start at boot the framework in the Raspberry PI
- collect and filter the data in the Raspberry PI
The programming languages/IDE used are:
- Wiring for the Arduino;
- Shell scripts for the load at boot of the framework in the Raspberry PI;
- Tcl scripts for the framework running in the Raspberry PI.
The linux OS running on the Raspberry PI is a minimal linux distribution based on Debian called Moebius (http://moebiuslinux.sourceforge.net/)
