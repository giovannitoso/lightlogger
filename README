light-logger is an open source framework to read, log and analyze data from from a light source (e.g. LED).
The framework was developed and tested by interfacing a VT90N2 LDR photoresistor, an Arudino UNO microcontroller and a Raspberry PI as embedded system.
The framework is provided with scripts to:
- interface the photoresistor with the Arduino board;
- interface the Arduino with the Raspberry PI;
- start at boot the framework in the Raspberry PI;
- collect and to filter the data in the Raspberry PI.
The programming languages/IDE used are:
- Wiring and Arduino integrated development environment for the Arduino;
- shell scripts for the load at boot of the framework in the Raspberry PI;
- tcl scripts for the framework running in the Raspberry PI.
The linux OS running on the Raspberry PI is a minimal linux distribution based on Debian called Moebius (http://moebiuslinux.sourceforge.net/)
